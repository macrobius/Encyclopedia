## Prologue

Whitespace (which is here)[http://whigdev.com/white/index.php?threads/whigdev-divisa-est-in-partes-tres.1944/]  - the lobby of the library



Previous Dissent (archival threads) - think of these as the 'vertical file'



St Theodore's Institute (STI) - course ware.  There might be a course catalog somewhere, and also author, title, and subject catalogs



-----



The wiki of all wiki's is resource id 231 (resid 231), available through a 'persistant URL' -- a White one, Gordo -- thus:  http://purl.org/white?id=231



Are there red and blue URLs?  Yes, but not where you would guess.  There are other resids too of course -- not all are public, however.



-----



The top level is divided into:



a) 911 -- Is this an Emergency? (quick and important links)



b) Perspectives or views -- different ways to see the whole



c) Collections (libraries have various named Collections, usually)



d) A List of Topics



Many collections and links lead off-site of course.  This is, after all, a 'web'.



-----

It shouldn't be hard to find 'the Stacks' or the 'Reserve List' (which is called 'The Small Library')... or the vertical files -- which are the threads, each thread -- or, a vertical file folder, if you understand how paper-based libraries work



The threads are located across five different domains, so you will need to follow the links or find the introduction to 'The Circle of Crust'



-----

If you want the 'subject catalog' try Mr Jefferson's Library perspective, then look for JDNs (Jefflib Domain Nodes) -- they are a Knowledge Engineering concept, but work a lot like Dewey Decimal.  You will probably feel at home.
