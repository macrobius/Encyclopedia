Future home of an Encyclopedia.

Check out the wiki at this github site.

Only current content is under the directory `thomism`

https://github.com/macrobius/Encyclopedia/blob/main/thomism/preface.md

Other readme files will be available under the directories, but that's all for now.

The readable version of this website will be at https://macrobius.substack.com

See TOC.md for a 'site map' of what's here.

For those wishing depth, start at `encyclopedia\README.md` or here, with the Christian Fathers https://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/
