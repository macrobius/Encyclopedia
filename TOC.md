The primary introduction to this site is README.md

The only thing written so far is thomism/preface.md

There are two tracks here:

Track 1 - for homeschoolers and Classical Christian Eduation (CCE)
Track 2 - for persons with a STEM background interested in Thomism

Here are the other planned directories:

archives/ - just archival material

compuation/ - for Track 2 (Technical) students, who are interested
 in computer programming

encyclopedia_preface/ - main introductino for Track 1 (persons learning
Latin and Greek, or homeschooling CCE children - the deep dive)

esotericism/ - a detour for persons interested in Gnosticism, the
Western Esoteric Tradition, and how it impacts /us/.

history_of_ideas/ - a parking lot for any badly conceived urges towards
historicism

homeschooling/ - the main hub for people raising children

jaap_bax/ - about the website of a philosopher who discusses Thomism and
Quantum Mechanics.  Definitely Track 2 (STEM track)

Chemistry, or Biology.  Geography, Geology, Oceanography, Meteorology,
and Planetary Science in general

platonism/ - the Old gods and the New.  Be prepared to take the Black.

political_theory/ - for those especially interested

preface/ - introductory materials

quantum_theory/ - Definitely Track 2 (Technical, STEM)

scholasticism/ - a bit more general than thomism, including the first, 
second, and third scholastic.  Track 1

your students can read

thomism/ - the primary target of Track 1, and the quickest entree into
other materials
