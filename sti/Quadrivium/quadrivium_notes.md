### The order of 'Math' in the Rhetoric Phase

Saxon has Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Advanced Mathematics (Trigonometry and pre-Calculus), and Calculus

p. 665 has charts for math sequence - avoid not getting to Calculus by grade 12.

Early Start: Algebra I, Geometry (8th), then B with extra year, like C

A. Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II with Trigonometry/Pre-Calculus, Calculus

B. Geometry, Algebra II, Trigonometry/Pre-Calculus, Calculus

C. Geometry, Advanced Mathematics (with Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus), 
Calculus and Differential Equations, Statistics and Probability or Multivariate Calculus
### The Order of 'Science' in the Rhetoric Phase

A. Biology, Chemistry, Geology/Meteorology/Astronomy/Ecology,
Physics but prefer B

B. Biology, Chemistry, Physics, advanced Science

Physics and Music Theory is a better match than Geology and Music Theory

### What about Euclid?

Greenleaf Press
Heath
Online
Playfair's Euclid
Euclid and his modern rivals

## About Philosophy and the Aristotelian-Aquinas Curriculum

## The 'Three Philosophies' in High School?

## Freshman Year in the Rhetoric Phase

### 9th Grade Trivium

Martin Cothran, Classical Rhetoric with Aristotle: Traditional Principles of Speaking and Writing. With Aristotle's Rhetoric and Adler's How to read a book

p. 606 - Progymnasmata

ch. 27, p. 621 Great Books

### 9th Grade Quadrivium

A. Saxon Algebra I if needed (no, or later Euclid)

B. Playfair's Euclid this year and next

Computer Science, Scientific Computation, and Computer Programming
