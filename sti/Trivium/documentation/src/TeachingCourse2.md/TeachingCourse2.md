Course Announcement for FALL 2024: https://x.com/weremight/status/1824877602190070139

Intended Audience (teachers in training for a cottage or traditional school, parent teachers of a homeschool, autodidacts, possibly some students with careful mentoring, as the curriculum is untested).

The course is, naturally, divided into Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior year.  The entire Trivium is necessarily covered in Freshman year, because it is so necessary for the full programme.  In modern terms, the Trivium is 'Language Arts' and the Quadrivium is the common material, mostly Mathematics, for the STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).  Since these are so necessary in the modern world, we are forced to compress the Classical Education curriculum a bit, to both the Trivium and first part of the Quadrivium in the first year!  This ends up making all the subjects very highly connected (a good thing, but requiring explanation to highlight it properly) and requires very careful sequencing to make sure the required elements are introduced before the subjects that need them.

These workbooks so far only cover the Freshman year (so that it can begin in Fall 2024!).  They are meant to cover main teaching guide, 'the book', which is only virtual for now, and only partly available at Substack[1] (where it is being serialised), and this pinned Twitter/X Thread[2]:

Freshman Year closely parallel's Sister Miriam's The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric

https://www.amazon.com/Trivium-Liberal-Logic-Grammar-Rhetoric/dp/0967967503/

This text should, if possible, be purchased.  The book is inexpensively available, at least on Kindle (which can use the web browser reader).  However if you unable to afford a copy, the workbooks and main text should cover the material in sufficient depth, though you will be missing an important resource and quite a treat to read.

Track 1, as I said, covers the basic and essential elements of the Trivium, and is heavily loaded in Freshman Year

Track 2 requires Track 1 and gives *additional* materials for classical languages (only Latin in Freshman Year), and for STEM Subjects (Science and Mathematics), as well as more depth in the Philosophies of Aristotle, Plato, and the Scholastic Philosophy (Aquinas).

For further information, see the Curriculum Design Notes (to be published but available at this twitter thread)[4]:

Treatment of Latin, Science, Math, Theology; Great Books, History, and Literature omitted

Track 1, Track 2, Pedagogical Notes, and 'Track 3' with Curriculum Design Notes
Track 2 is for: Latin and Greek, Prose Composition, STEM, and the Scholastic Philosophy

Primary Texts:

What if I can't obtain the texts?  Don't worry - we provide free online materials and workbooks, though you will be missing out on a fine text.

Follows Sister Miriam Joseph's _The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric_ closely
Optionally, Lear's introduction to Aristotle (See Track 2 Below)

Optional primary materials:

Cothran on Logic and Rhetoric (TODO: requires links [5] and elaboration)
Aristotle's Rhetoric and Poetics (TODO: requires links and elaboration)

Cothran's work available at Memoria Press recommended for directness and simplicity (NOTE: I have no financial interest in the publisher).  You only need to buy the student workbook, not all the materials, unless you are teaching children the subject.  I have not examined the teacher's materials, so have opinion on them.

Track 1 texts for Freshman Year:

Workbooks for Trivium ch. 1-3

TBD

Grammar Review

(this document)

Track 2 texts for Freshman Year:

NOTE: only Philosophy, Mathematics, and Logic (essentially the Trivium) will initially have workbooks.  For Classical Languages and Science you will need to purchase the book and learn the subject on your own, if you don't know it as a teacher.  Further guidance will be provided later, as the Homeschooling curriculum materials (that is, the K-8 Grammar Phase and Dialectic Phase) are fleshed out.  Since these will be intended for children, they should be very easy for adult learners.  Or not. :D

Fortunately, homeschooling curricula Classical Christian Education (CCE) is a very well-populated space -- mostly in need of correction to teach the REAL Trivium and Quadrivium, but somewhat competent in other subjects.

### Latin

Latin Guide workbook (TBD)

Henle, Latin and Grammar[7]:

[7]: https://www.christianbook.com/page/homeschool/foreign-languages/latin/henle-latin?search=henle&search_term=henle&ps_exit=RETURN|legacy

You need the blue grammar and purple first year book.

### Philosophy

Workbook introduction to Aristotle is included in Track 1 materials.

No materials for Plato's dialogues are provided at this time.  Read Allan Bloom's Closing of the American Mind as an introduction to Plato, for now.

Aristotle's Organon, and selections from Physics, de Anima, etc. (LINK TBD)
Hamilton and Cairns, The Collected Dialogues of Plato (LINK TBD)

Scholastic Philosophy: read the texts of Coppen's (on Logic and Mental Philosophy, and Moral Philosophy) and Brother Louis of Poissy's short summa (all three texts are very short and linked in the main book's introductory material).  These will be referenced and discussed in the primary text and workbooks, but are Track 1 optional, Track 2 required.  Simply pursue the topic using the Track 1 materials.

### Mathematics
Euclid's Elements (required text for Track 2, recommended for Track 1)

The corresponding workbook is included in Track 1 materials because it relates closely to Logic and Mathematical Proofs ('demonstrations' and deduction)

### Logic

Required Text for this Review:  https://ia802804.us.archive.org/14/items/mcgrawhillhandbo00shaw/mcgrawhillhandbo00shaw.pdf

In this document, we do a quick review of 'The Grammar Phase'.  Even though Sister Miriam Joseph's book The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric covers the whole Trivium, and has the subtitle Understanding the Nature and Function of Language, both that book and we have to assume the student has learned something of Reading, Writing, and Reckoning, and therefore also of  the Alphabet, Pronunciation, Accentuation, Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar, of at least the English language, before starting High School!

While this was competently done, and universally, in the English-speaking public and private schools of the mid 20th century, it has become increasingly dubious, especially for Generation Alpha, who will consider that time 'the last century' and have no personal experience of it.  But we have to start somewhere, and if Classical Education is to begin at 'High School age' without the advantage of a REAL Grammar School, so be it.  In the future, it might be necessary to have an 'introductory year' or at least a preliminary class devoted to making up any deficit, in either Latin or English.

It is of course also true that many speakers of English, worldwide, have learned it as a second language, the universal language of trade, commerce, and increasingly of technology.  While it is an inestimable advantage to have been raised as a native speaker of English, the educational difference between native and foreign speakers is decreasing rapidly---not least due to the decline of 'Classical Education' (Christian or otherwise) among native speakers of the language of Globalism.  We should also remember, that while English, and once French and German, were the vernacular languages of Western culture, our 21st century native speakers of those languages are likely to be less educated than in the 19th and 20th centuries, and in fact to use their /own/ languages in an academic educated fashion, are initially in no more advantaged position that a foreign speaker.   

To a very real degree, the Classical languages of the West---Latin and Greek---alongside Sanskrit, Hebrew and Arabic a bit further east, and the languages of East Asia, are worth learning in their proper sphere, if one wants to rise about the level of oral culture and English Trading Jargon.  That is, to be literate in one's /own/ culture.

For now, while we are 'teaching the teachers' of that future school that will give children or young adults a Classical Education in the Liberal Arts, they likely are still of an age where they received, in the 20th century or a bit beyond, some benefit from their elementary or secondary educations, and thus have some of the prerequisites for Logic and Rhetoric.  You will notice, however that Sister Miriam Joseph puts Logic first, in the title of her work, and mentions Grammar only in passing.  This is because she starts by relating Grammar, assumed known, to her first interest, Logic, and then proceeds to Rhetoric and Poetry (i.e., Prose Composition and Versification) in her final Chapter 11.

We thus have, in her book, a suitable introduction to the 'Rhetoric Phase' and an adequate summary of both Logic and Rhetoric, completing the Trivium.

My approach in this Grammar Review is to cover only the bare minimum of English grammar, to understand what she assumes her pupils, both students and teachers, will already know, but is seldom the case today, 70 dark years later.  That is, such things as the names of the parts of speech, the sorts of things you might find in a dictionary, how to parse or diagram a sentence, and the basic terminology of English grammar as received in the mid 20th century.

For this purpose, our text will be the McGraw-Hill Handbook of English from about 1960.  More or less any similar contemporary text would do---these sorts of things were intended to be a final revision, in 8th grade, of an Elementary or Grammar School education.  Knowing them well now would, of course, be a credit to any college Freshman.

Required Text for this Review:  https://ia802804.us.archive.org/14/items/mcgrawhillhandbo00shaw/mcgrawhillhandbo00shaw.pdf

We will, for this review, only cover the first 9 sections, on the basics of Grammar (put to p. 61, and the Appendix (section 102, starting p. 480) on Sentence Diagramming.  But let use spend some time perusing the contents of the book:

![][grammar]

The page depicted covers Grammar, Usage, Capitalisation, and Punctuation.  The remaining sections cover correctness and style ('the word' and 'the sentence') and the basics of English Composition:

the paragraph
the whole theme
the research paper
the precis and paraphrase
writing for special purposes
listening and thinking (logic)

Finally, at the end, there is a section on sentence diagramming.

We see, then, that the bulk of this handbook is on the art of Rhetoric, and especially those portions known as lexis (word choice) and syntaxis (the construction of sentences).

Then it moves on to the composition of longer works, which is very properly the work of Rhetoric.  Thus, we will omit the sections on Rhetoric until later, when we will have a similar workbook reviewing 'English Prose Composition' at the appropriate time.

In keeping with Early modern and 19th/20th century in English, very little time is given to Logic or Critical Thinking, though to frame an argument or composition it cannot be completely neglected, and is given one small section.

Omitted entirely in the handbook are the matters, besides Capitalisation and Punctuation, which are present, of the Alphabet, the correct Pronunciation of English, Spelling (Orthography), Accentuation, Phrasing and Intonation while reading aloud or speaking, as well as Prosody.  

The Classical subject of Grammar treats all of the above.  

Also omitted from the subject of Rhetoric are: Memorising your speech, proper Gesturing (Acting, or Performance, of the speech), and again everything pertaining to 'Public Speaking', including proper diction, and suitability of when to speak, and with what ceremony ('Parliamentary Law' or Robert's Rules of Order).



#### Considerations Teaching Latin Alongside English ####
Needless to say, also omitted, in a typical 20th century treatment such as this, is any mention of LATIN.  That is because, in the typical education of the time, while at least early in the century Public Schools still taught four years of Latin 'as a foreign language' [!], this was *after* the review of Grammar School in 8th grade.  In the period of Classical Education---certainly down to the time of the Founding Fathers and indeed until 1820 and beyond---‘grammar school' meant, primarily, Latin Grammar.  English Grammar and Rhetoric were taught, almost as an afterthought and appendix to teaching Latin.

In this review, we will give a preparation both for the Trivium in English (Track 1), and at least some pointers to prepare those pursuing Track 2, which includes doing the typical '4 years of High School Latin' (equivalent to 2 college years of Latin at a slower pace) and/or the Quadrivium.  It would be a very good thing if at least the teachers teaching Classical Education according to the Trivium, were to know Latin; and a better thing, if their students learn it.

For that reason, in this Grammar review, we will glance briefly at the corresponding material for both Latin and English, and emphasize that in Classical Education there is an economy in learning Latin and English together.  In fact, in the Early Modern era, they share a single set of pronunciation rules (long and short vowels pronounced identically, so also consonants), use more or less the same alphabet, have the same terminology of grammar, the same way of diagramming sentences, and share a common set of spelling rules.  In fact, all the hard bits for native English speakers learning their /own/ language come from omitting the teaching of Latin at the same time.

#### Reviewing 'The Alphabet' and Pronunciation, or Diction ####
Latin students in this Rhetoric Phase programme, starting Freshman Year, will use the (purple) text by Henle, and his small (blue) book on Latin Grammar.  Here is the first page of the latter:

![][SALy8iBCMsI7h5WbyvYZ_18_895d94c59fa85892c8f3dbf497c345b3_image]

Notice that he covers the Alphabet in one sentence, as if it is familiar to his students already, and also starts with Pronunciation, though he uses the Ecclesiastical (Church Latin) pronunciation, rather than the Anglo-Latin one common in English or American schools down to the mid Victorian era.

We will need to go into these topics in much more depth for a number of reasons.  First, while the Alphabet was relatively simple when the skills learned in school were manuscript writing ('printing'), cursive, and in high school 'personal typing'.  Now, with computers, 'input method editors' (IMEs) for some languages and mathematical typesetting (TeX).  Another factor is pronunciation -- now that English is a world language, many persons and even natives need to learn how to pronounce it properly, and the use of 'pronouncing dictionaries' for this purpose has declined.  Clicking on a 'how to pronounce' link online has its place, but sometimes you need to indicate *with precision*, how to say a word, in text.  

One possible solution is to make everyone learn to use Unicode and the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet).  This is a fairly complex process even on a desktop computer with a proficient keyboardist, and problem all but impossible on a mobile device.  Even clicking out letters one at a time on a mobile device (Swype or similar systems) is quite tedious.  When you add in the fact that Classical Languages use diacritic marks, in Latin to mark long vowels at least in school texts, as well as the usual complement of diacritic marks (acute and grave accents, umlauts and such) common to Western European languages using the 'Latin Alphabet', and also consider the Greek alphabet, using polytonic accents, which are just as complex -- it is evident some discussion about 'the alphabet' and 'pronunciation' is needed, as well as 'how do I represent mathematical formulae on a computer'.

Therefore, this review has appendices on these topics, The Alphabet, Pronunciation, and so forth.  These are written in the 'pyramid style' of 20th century journalism, so you can get the gist by reading the first part, and then more and more depth if you keep going.  Feel free to read Appendices A and B (TBD - not yet available in this text) either now or at any time.  Persons proceeding along Track 2 should *complete* all the material in those appendices, on the writing and pronunciation of Latin, and the typesetting of mathematics 'online', at the beginning of Freshman Year.  Those teaching Track 2 certainly should!

Those pursuing Track 1 should skim the first part on the Alphabet (Appendix A) and the parts of Appendix B on Pronunciation as it pertains to English Diction.
#### Grammar both General and Special, and Diagramming ####
Sister Miriam Joseph discusses both the grammar of specific languages, such as English and Latin, and what she (and the Scholastic philosophers) call *general grammar*, which underlies all languages.  Whether this is true or not, it is certainly true that at least the Indo-European languages -- more or less all the European languages except for Basque, Finnish, and Hungarian, and all the languages of the Americas, except those spoken by American 'Indians' in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere -- share a great deal of both grammar and word stock.  The 'Indo-European' languages, in fact spread to India, witness Sanskrit (a classical language), Hindi and related languages, and embrace Persian and related languages in Iran.

Deeper than that, modern linguistics has found grammar to have not only a sort of surface structure, but deeper levels, that can be represented as 'parse trees' in a similar fashion, no matter what the language, along with rules of transformation and generation of (novel) sentences.  Transformational-Generational grammar is not the latest thing, though it had antecedents, applied to Latin, in Early Modern Europe, and only fell out of style during the 19th century, before making a comeback in the 20th.  In any event, even if it is not the 'latest thing' link linguistics, as it was during the heyday of Noam Chomsky at MIT, it is certainly important for understanding Natural Language Processing in Computer Science.

Given those facts, it is very reasonable for the Trivium to point out how the nouns, verbs, declensions, and conjugations and parts of speech of a typical Indo-European language 'work', and also to generalise from grammar and sentences in spoken or written language, to concepts and propositions in logic.  Rational discourse is possible in any of the civilised languages of the world, and probably any of them at all, even the ones without mature writing systems or standardised national forms.  Some languages have long histories, of course, of being a vehicle for religious or philsophical or scientific discourse, and these are all most suitable for the Liberal Arts.

The 'parts of speech' and much of the grammatical vocabulary are the same in English and Latin, for the reasons given above.  Nouns are the names of things, persons, or places and the like--exactly what 'the like' entailed will be discussed early on in the Trivium text.  Verbs stand for either actions, or can be what we now call the 'Linking Verb' (is, are and the various tenses of the verb to be).  Adjectives and Adverbs are modifiers, respectively, of nouns and verbs.  Besides the three primary parts of speech, there are also pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections.  

Pronouns are sometimes called 'noun substitutes' and function, grammatically, as nouns.  Interjections are easily dealt with, as they represent simple 'cries' and do not really function grammatically as 'part of a sentence' -- words like 'Ouch!' or 'Aha!'.

There are, in fact, at least four *kinds* of sentences:  Declarative (statements), Interrogative (queries), Imperative (commands), and Exclamatory, which last function somewhat like interjections:  'Oh how I wish I had been there!'

Prepositions and Conjunctions, and a handful of similar words, serve to tie the sentence together and indicate the grammar of the sentence.  In Scholastic philosophy, the words that name concepts--nouns and verbs and so on--are called categorematic ('category words'), and the function-words that have a meaning relative to context, such as conjunctions and prepositions, are syncategorematic.  In formal logic, 'and' 'or' and 'not' play a similar role, as logical connectives that always have the same logical or mathematical meaning, compared to the words needed to discuss the 'subject matter' of the propositions and syllogisms.

We will return to all these matters in the first few chapters of the book, and certainly in depth for Track 2, as we learn Latin.  This is enough of an introduction for now, besides reading the first eight sections of our review book, and skimming the terms in the ninth section (glossary).

The sections proceed via the various parts of speech we have mentioned (sections 1-5), and then larger groupings of words--phrases, clauses, and sentences.
