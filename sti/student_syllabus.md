## St Theodore's Institute Classical Liberal Arts Curriclum

(student syllabus)

St Theodore's Institute offers a curriculum for teaching the Classical Liberal Arts, including Mathematics and Science.  This syllabus describes the first four years of the seven year programme, which can be used as early as ages 14-18, or at the 'college' level.  This sample is for 'High School' aged children, i.e., American grades 9-12.

NOTE: This programme is planned for academic year 2025-2026.  An intrepid student could follow it, however, as it is created 'in real time' in Fall 2024.

The curriculum is divided, each year, into the following 'courses' for convenience:

Seminar (the integrated Classical Liberal Arts Curriculum)
Classics (Latin and (optional) Greek)
Mathematics
Science
A Practical

Both Student and Teacher manuals (will be) provided and you can see the progress in creating them at https://macrobius.substack.com

Most of the materials for 'taking the curriculum' exist today, and will be linked below.  However the most important parts of the 'Seminar' -- the Trivium and Quadrivium -- are still being written up (Fall 2024).  

The STEM parts of the Quadrivium (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) are mostly links to existing materials and broken out for convenience.  

## The Practicals

Practicals require an instructor, online audio-visual materials (at a minimum), or a laboratory such as a language lab or a science lab

Other examples are field work and practice (e.g., team sports, some Geology and Biology, with a Naturalist), penmanship and calligraphy, plastic arts, machine or automotive shop. Learning a modern vernacular language or a capella singing would be other examples of a practical.  Traditional Latin can be learned if you have access to a Traditional Mass, and Traditional Greek can be learned in some churches of the Greek Archdiocese in North America.  Both will use the typical 'early modern' pronunciation ('Ecclesiastical Latin' and 'Koine Greek' respectively).

The following practicals are described in the curriculum:

The pronunciation of English and Latin (Diction)
Debate or Original Oratory
Public Speaking
Parliamentary Law (participating in the formal meetings of an organisation)

# Mathematics and Science

It is very much preferred if the student can complete 'Algebra I' in the Saxon Math series, before beginning the programme.  However, it is possible to do the traditional American High School Mathematics series, as an alternative.  This is represented in Saxon Math (for example), by Algebra I, Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, Algebra II, Calculus.  This is five courses in four years, which has inconvenient phasing.  Trigonometry and Algebra II are commonly combined into an 'Advanced Mathematics' course, given Junior year.

This still does not achieve the full programme, which is given here, that gets to 'Advanced Calculus', which in American seems only to be taught in elite prep schools.  Our curriculum gives the complete programme, but in many cases, if a university education is going to follow, getting to Calculus by Senior Year should be enough, even for STEM students.

## Freshman Mathematics and Science

If the student already has Algebra I (in, for example, the Saxon Math series, from 7th or 8th grade, then Geometry for Mathematics.

For Natural Science, we propose studying General Biology this year, with no set text specified (yet).  If Biology or Chemistry have been 'recently done', say in the two preceding years, consider moving Sophomore Chemistry back one year to make room for an additional science from the 'Advanced' list, perhaps in Junior year.

The Science curriculum is still somewhat fluid and under discussion.

Wikibooks does have a 'General Biology' text free and online, but as many have noted, it is more like a set of student notes, if comprehensive, with links to wikipedia articles.

### Euclid

Euclid (and Geometry) are a core subject for the Quadrivium and our 'Euclid supplement' aims to be authentic in this regard.  The Saxon Math Geometry text or similar may be substituted if preferred.

### Euclid Online

Paper editions, such as XX from Greenleaf Press or the three-volume set by Heath, available in Dover Reprint

For our course, we will key to the online texts available:

https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html

Heath's Euclid commentary is available at:

## Sophomore Mathematics and Science

Euclid, continued, along with Advanced Mathematics

https://dev.azure.com/jegoodwin30088/Daynotes/_wiki/wikis/Daynotes.wiki/5106/Advanced-Mathematics-analysis

If not done Freshman Year, then we need General Chemistry this year

Required text:

Pauling, General Chemistry
https://www.amazon.com/General-Chemistry-Dover-Books/dp/0486656225 

Yes, I know it is an old text (first edition, 1947), however it is very inexpensive, and still suitable for our purposes.  It is still needed
