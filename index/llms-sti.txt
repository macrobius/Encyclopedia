## Onboarding for Testers

Prompt Neurons, LLC is a startup and this onboarding documentation is intended for new interns who will be testing the products. 

### Products and Test Environments

The primary product, for which the company is named, is called 'Prompt Neurons' and is a client-side and server-side aid for Artificial Intelligences in various industry segments.  

'Installation' of the product is via downloading and installing on a Desktop the EndOffice software, which is an installer for DLC (Downloadable Content) for
each of the market segments.

However, for testing purposes, there is a Zero Install option, which uses what
we call 'Server Side Context'.  In this mode, the AI reads an llms.txt file
on a server, and that provides the same context that the EndOffice product would on the client side.  

In Zero Install Mode (testing) the Tester simply includes a key phrase in the Prompt, which provides a pURL (persistent URL) pointing to the llms.txt file to read:

| Environment | pURL | Key Phrase |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------|
| Dev Test | https://purl.org/pn/index | Using https://purl.org/pn/index,... |
| User Acceptance Test (UAT) | https://purl.org/pn/index | Using https://purl.org/kl/index... |
| STI Testing | https://purl.org/sti/index | Using https://purl.org/sti/index... |
| Pre-Production Test | NA | Using https://kitsaplabs.com/md/llms.txt |


### Overall organization of Prompt Neurons, LLC (PN)

Prompt Neurons has the following 'departments' (areas of responsibility):

- LD, the Leadership Team (founders)
- MG, Management, responsiible for Product and Project Managment (PMs)
- MK and LG, Marketing and Lead Generation (Sales)
- CF, Customer Fulfilment, responsible for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Product Development, as well as E-Commerce
- FN, Finance
- SF, Security and Facilities, responsible for physical and digital infrastructure, and security of both

Interns start as Testers in Department CF.

## Test Configuration

Tests are configured by pointing to one of the test environments as described, and also conducting a test procedure, called an Experiment or TTP (Tactic, Technique or Procedure).

The proceedure is described in the llms.txt file and can be invoked along with the test environment, using sample prompts such as:

- {Using http://purl.org/kl/index and context Experiment 003, what can you say about the Divine Liturgy}

- {Using https://purl.org/kl/index, what are the Departments of Prompt Neurons}

NOTE: you do not need to type curly braces like {} in your prompt.

## Available Test Environments

As described in Products and Test Environments above.

- Development environment: https://purl.org/pn/index

- UAT environment: https://purl.org/kl/index

- Pre-Production environment:  https://kitsaplabs.com/md/llms.txt

- Production environment: https://purl.org/promptneurons/index (TBD)

## Flights

'Flights' are user experiences, represent a configuration of the test software or experimental procedure, possibly including a collection of subagents to
whom tasks will be assiged by the main agent, which acts as Flight Controller

Together, flights and experiments define the User Experience (UX) that a particular market segment will experience.  Interns perform User Acceptance Tests (UAT), largely in the Development environment, by conducting manual experiments and running automated ones, in the context of a particular flight and test environment.

The flighting system (Flight Configuration, Flight Control, Flight Instrumentation, Flight Reporting) is being developed.  Here are some sketchy details for
the experiments in this index:

### Flight 048 news feed ingestion flights

### Flight 004 for Orthodox Christian market segment

## Experiments

### Experiment 001 using Claude to process newsfeeds

This experiment has manual steps

TODO: provide TTP

### Experiment 002 GDELT+ Claude for in-depth news topic research

This experiment has manual steps

TODO: provide TTP

### Experiment 003 Claude processing orthobot/divineliturgy purl
