# Summary: New-Leaf

**New-Leaf** is a major organizational initiative spanning years 14052-14070+ (appears to use Julian Day Numbers) focused on restructuring and consolidating multiple personal/professional projects and knowledge systems.

## Core Purpose

A "focus project" to organize 9-14 years of accumulated work across:
- Personal knowledge management (PKM)
- Digital asset management
- Self-training and learning initiatives
- Classical education curriculum (STI - St Theodore's Institute)
- Technical projects (ML/NLP, Nuclear Physics)
- Professional networking and consulting

## Key Problems Being Addressed

From Daynotes/14052/New-Leaf.md:
- Finding artifacts or notes (search and discovery)
- Backups and preservation
- Installation and bootstrap procedures
- Context/workspace recovery

## Main Components

### 1. Knowledge Organization System

**Upper Ontology**: 10 main classes based on modified Dewey Decimal
- **JDN 0**: Factotum (Reference/Metadata)
- **JDN 1**: Doctrine (History, Philosophy, Linguistics)
- **JDN 2**: Applied Science (Engineering, CS, Medicine)
- **JDN 3**: Pure Science (Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
- **JDN 4-5**: Social Sciences

### 2. Infrastructure Projects

- Thread/Substack/Twitter indices
- Miro board visualization system (multiple boards for different domains)
- Azure DevOps wiki integration
- "Top O' The Web" portal system
- Digital asset management ("Silage")

### 3. Active Epics (275-290)

- Learning Foci and Map
- Broken Things and Tickle List
- CRM/Contacts setup (HubSpot)
- Gherkin/Specflow support
- **STI Buildout** (#289) - Classical education curriculum
- **Prompt Neurons Buildout** (#290) - AI/ML project

### 4. Time-Based Organization

**Quarterly structure**: FY2024Q3/Q4, FY2025Q1-Q3

**Period-based**: 14060, 14061, 14062, 14070, 14071

## Notable Subprojects

### Sand Dollar DR Manual

"The Ultimate Boomer Prepper Guide" covering:
- Emergency preparedness and disaster recovery
- Digital security and privacy
- CBRN preparedness
- HAM radio and emergency communications
- Environmental monitoring
- Digital prepping and archival strategies

### Period 14060 Focus (50+ documents)

- Learning tracks with metadata organization
- Classical curriculum recommendations
- Thomism, Evolution, Quantum Mechanics studies
- Python/R/PostgreSQL learning
- Edge Kubernetes projects
- Crisis logging and institutional vs. realism studies

## Integration Points

### With Encyclopedia Project

- STI (St Theodore's Institute) appears in both projects
- Classical education curriculum development
- Liberal arts taxonomy alignment
- Shared focus on Thomism and scholasticism

### External Resources

- Miro boards for visual organization
- Azure DevOps for project management
- OneDrive for asset storage
- Multiple pURL systems (persistent URLs)
- Linktree coordination: linktr.ee/macrobius

## Philosophy

Based on "The Map is not the Territory" - emphasis on:
- Multiple indexing strategies
- Visual knowledge mapping
- Scholastic philosophy integration
- Self-directed learning paths
- Archive preservation ("Archivery")

## Current Status

Active reorganization initiative starting 14060, with transition to "Daynotes2" wiki structure planned. Appears to be consolidating decades of work into coherent, searchable, backed-up knowledge systems supporting both personal research and educational publishing goals.
